explodeSQL
==========

Very small tool to create SQL scripts from simple datasource such as csv files..

Well just got tired of writing small script every time I had to generate SQL-scrips
for spreasheets and such.. so her it is.. 

Take a look at the example.csql, I bet you will be able to figure out how to use it.
